# PDFConverse
PDFConverse is a chatbot that makes reading and interacting with PDF documents easier and more engaging.  Here's how it works: You give it a PDF, maybe a report, a book, or any document, and it reads it through. Then, it's ready to have a conversation with you about what's in the PDF. ðŸ“šðŸ’¬ðŸ¤–
